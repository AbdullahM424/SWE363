IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This application is for KFUPM university students who want to know about the university, and access study material or have info about the facilities and student clubs offered in the university. 

To execute the application first, clone the repository.
After cloning the repository, you should install the dependencies by typing "npm install" in the root directory.

you should also install react router dom by writing "npm react-router-dom" and also install bootstrap with "npm install bootstrap"
When you are done, just type npm start and you are set!

NOTES:
1- we built the application with a little different design than the one in phase 4. We concluded that this is for the best because we were not entirely convinced about the UI in the design phase.

2- When you register or log in, you should type an email that has ".com" and "@" just like a regular email, otherwise you will not be able to access the other pages.
Also the password MUST consist of 6 letters atleast.

3 - When the user is of type "admin" he/she will have power to delete courses or add ones. You can change the type of the user by going into "App.js" and changing "isAdmin" to false if you want to be a regular user or to true if you want to be an admin.

4- In the clubs page, there is a button for adding a new club, however, it does function because we do not have the data and the button appears just to clarify that a club leader might add his own club, where we will insert this functionality in the backend phase.
